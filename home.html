In fact, I did not have such benevolent aims. Many of my friends were doing it, and the 'Gold Award' would be another positive aspect of my UCAS form and CV.<p>However, the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme has developed me. Prior to starting, I had no idea of using a compass (often having severe consequences), whereas now I am indeed slightly more competent. There are other advantages: you do have to take responsibility, and you will gain many pragmatic skills which will of help to you in life after the Award. But theaward.org is very conscience that you should only do the Award if you will have fun doing it.<p>One testament to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award is that, despite bearing severe pain several times both in the practice in Dartmoor, and on the hills of the Lake District, despite the blisters and cramp, I have salvaged enjoyment from it. Maybe its one of things you only enjoy after the event; certainly looking back on it now, nearly all that I can remember is positive(although I can remember some of the atrocities we faced on Dartmoor). When, though, the sun shone (which was not often enough) I even enjoyed the gruelling walks.<p>I have to say that I have gained from the Award far beyond what I was expecting, and even the worst aspects are fun to remember. It certainly challenged me physically and gave me many practical skills and valuable memories. Therefore I would suggest to anyone thinking of doing the Award to at least give Bronze a try, as you will gain more than merely something for your CV.<p>I would also, here, like to thank all the people who came on the trip and especially to Mr Summers who had to organise many aspects late on as Capt. Billington left only a month before our expedition.</div>

<a name="mission"></a><img src="images/mission.jpg" width="500"><p>
<br><p><div align="center"><img src="images/mission2.jpg"></div><p><div align="justify">The basic aim of the Expedition section of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award is to "encourage a spirit of adventure and discovery". To achieve this you are compelled to undertake a 4 day trek, staying in campsites, with minimal contact with civilisation (to make you self-dependent).<p>For the Gold level in walking you must spend a minimum of <b>8 hours each day</b> in Planned Activity (e.g. journeying, navigation, setting up camp) and cover <b>80km / 50 miles</b> over the 4 day expedition.<p>Having done our practice in Dartmoor in Easter, the Lake District's more walkable terrain was certainly appealing. However, when carrying a 20kg pack up and down mountains, it certainly lost its novelty after a while.<p>During the expedition, an assessor will meet with your group at certain places on your route and/or at your campsites. He is responsible for your success and fortunately the whole of our group was passed at the end of our trip.</div><p><center>Our route can be found <a href="maps.html">here</a>.</center>

<div align="justify">A group must comprise a minimum of 4 people and a maximum of 7. Our group, the only one from which nobody dropped out on the practice, consisted of 6 people (seen below, + Matthew Coffey). As a team we worked well together, equally taking responsibility concerning map reading, setting up camp, and cooking.</div><p>
